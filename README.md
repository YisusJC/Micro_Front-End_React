# Micro frontend-react

Micro Front-end react apps created by Create-React-App

Micro-frontend architecture is a design approach in which a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent “microapps” working loosely together.

Run miro front-end Apps:
Container App: http://localhost:3000
SubApp1: http://localhost:4001
SubApp2: http://localhost:4002

Install npm packages on each folder `npm install`

Execute start by each one of them `npm start` and open on browser http://localhost:3000 that is the main app.

If you have problems with the next error...

```
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

Try to execute npm start with node version 15 or 16
